Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities 
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity 
Creates a second, independent tidy data set


The end result is shown in the file tidydata.txt.
